# nParse

nParses analyzes log files entries on Netrake/Audiocodes nCite Session Border Controllers,
and checks for potential SIP based attackers. The data discovered can then be used for
firewall rules or analysis of attackers targeting the nCite SBC.

It is a simple shell script so there is no need to install python, ruby, and will work
against all instances of nCite.
